## What Does it Do?
This is a TKinter GUI where you can encrypt and decrypt messages with keys. This only works with Text. (This includes links)

## What if I'm Handling Sensative Information? 
I recommend encrypting it 3+ times with different keys for each if handling sensative information. I also recommend writting half of the keys on paper and half on a computer.
## How To Run? 
open a CMD prompt window and CD into your directory. Then type ```Encrypt.py```
